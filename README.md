# 🧠 RTL Metastability Handling Circuit

**Verilog implementation of an RTL-level synchronizer circuit to ensure reliable data transfer across asynchronous clock domains.**

---

## 📌 Project Summary

Metastability is a critical issue in digital systems with multiple clock domains. This project presents an RTL-based design using multi-stage flip-flop synchronizers to mitigate metastability effects and ensure signal stability during clock domain crossing (CDC).

## ⚙️ Features

- Two-stage and three-stage synchronizer architectures
- Clock domain crossing signal protection
- Optional asynchronous reset and debounce logic
- Simulatable on industry tools (Synopsys VCS / EDA Playground)
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) evaluation

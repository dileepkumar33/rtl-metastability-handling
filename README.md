# rtl-metastability-handling
Verilog implementation of an RTL-level metastability handling circuit using synchronizer design to ensure reliable data transfer across clock domains.
This project implements a Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuit in Verilog to handle metastability in digital systems. It uses a two-flop synchronizer to safely transfer asynchronous signals between different clock domains, minimizing the risk of timing errors and data corruption. Suitable for FPGA or ASIC design flows.

# rtl-metastability-handling
Verilog implementation of an RTL-level metastability handling circuit using synchronizer design to ensure reliable data transfer across clock domains.
# RTL-Based Metastability Handling Circuit

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Register Transfer Level (RTL)-based circuit to safely handle metastability during asynchronous clock domain crossings.

#📌 Project Summary
Metastability is a major reliability concern in multi-clock digital systems. This project implements a robust RTL-level synchronizer using a multi-flip-flop architecture to mitigate timing violations and data corruption.

#⚙ Features
- Two-stage and three-stage flip-flop synchronizers
- Clock domain crossing (CDC) handling
- Optional debounce and reset logic
- Functional simulation using Synopsys VCS / EDA Playground
- MTBF analysis and resource evaluation
